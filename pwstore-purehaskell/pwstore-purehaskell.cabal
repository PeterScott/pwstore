Name:                pwstore-purehaskell
Version:             2.1.4
Synopsis:            Secure password storage, in pure Haskell.
Description:         To store passwords securely, they should be salted,
                     then hashed with a slow hash function. This library
                     uses PBKDF1-SHA256, and handles all the details.
                     It is implemented in pure Haskell, with no C
                     dependencies. For a faster implementation, the
                     pwstore-fast package has the exact same API but is
                     about 25 times faster due to its use of the cryptohash
                     package, which is partly implemented in C. This pure
                     Haskell version is visibly slower, but still quite usable.
